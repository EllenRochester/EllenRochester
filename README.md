## Hi, I'm Ellen!
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

<br />
I am deeply invested in data-focused roles, and proficient in tools like Tableau, SQL, R, Python, Apache Hadoop, and AWS. These technical skills, coupled with my business insight, enable me to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets for informed decision-making.

My interest in machine learning drives me to explore various models such as RNN, Transformers, and LLMs to enhance my analytical capabilities.
